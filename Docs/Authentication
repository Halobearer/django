JWT -- JSON web token
JWT stands for JSON Web Token.
It is a compact and self-contained way of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications

A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature

Header: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token,
which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. It is Base64Url encoded.

Payload: The payload contains the claims,
which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional metadata.

Signature: The signature is created by taking the encoded header,
the encoded payload, a secret key (or a private key in the case of RSA),
and applying the specified signing algorithm.
The signature is used to verify the authenticity of the token and ensure that it has not been tampered with.

JWT doesn't require a Database call
